# hi there

this is some website stuff for the dicetables_db repository.

it can run as-is by running `index.html`

inputs into the dicetable submit boxes are using `fakedata.js.fakeList`.
`mockjax` simply takes the int as an index and retuns that value from
the list.  see the header of `index.html` for details.
